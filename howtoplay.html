<h1> How to play </h1>
<hr>
<h2> Clicking </h2>
<p>Clicking the orange clickable will grant 1 point. These points can be spent to buy generators, and the goal of the game is to get as many points as possible. </p>
<hr>
<h2> Generators </h2>
<p>There are 5 generators. They cost points, and make more points, but the price for that generator will increase by 1.2x. To switch the generator you are buying, use the left/right arrow keys.</p>
<hr>
<h2> Defrag </h2>
<p>When you defrag a generator, its amount and price are reset, but you gain a multiplier to that generator with the formula (x/5)^(1/1.7) where x is the amount you bought of that generator.</p>
